# HMM-Part-of-Speech-Tagger

This is a project from the Udacity NLP Nanodegree which uses a Hidden Markov Model to model parts of speech. My role was to modify existing code, and is marked under the #TODO lines. All other code was provided by Udacity. Make sure that your Python notebook 
is running on Python 3.
